# Activate Zoho for Your Domain 🔐





This guide provides detailed instructions on how to activate Zoho Mail for your custom domain. With Zoho Mail, you can enjoy professional email services tailored to your domain name. Follow the steps below to set up MX and other DNS records.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Administrative access to your domain registrar's dashboard.
- A Zoho Mail account. You can sign up at [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/).

## Step 1: Access Zoho Mail Setup 🚀

1. Log in to your Zoho Mail account.
2. In the Zoho Mail dashboard, navigate to **Settings**.
3. Under **Domains**, click on **Add Domain**.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to add and verify your domain.

## Step 2: Configure MX Records ⚙️

MX (Mail Exchanger) records are essential for routing your domain's email traffic through Zoho Mail servers. Here are the MX records you need to configure:

| Priority | Host | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| 10       | @    | mx.zoho.com |
| 20       | @    | mx2.zoho.com |
| 50       | @    | mx3.zoho.com |

1. Access your domain registrar's dashboard.
2. Find the DNS or DNS Management section.
3. Add the MX records listed above. Ensure you set the correct priority values.
4. Save the changes. MX records may take some time to propagate.

## Step 3: Configure Other DNS Records ⚙️

Besides MX records, you may need to configure other DNS records for your domain to work seamlessly with Zoho Mail. Here are some common records:

### CNAME Records 🔄

| Host | Value |
|------|-------|
| @    | zb*****.verify.zoho.com (for domain verification) |
| imap | imap.zoho.com |
| pop   | pop.zoho.com |
| smtp | smtp.zoho.com |

### SPF Record ☀️

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records help prevent email spoofing.

| Host | Value |
|------|-------|
| @    | v=spf1 include:zoho.com ~all |

### DKIM Records 🔒

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) records enhance email security.

You can generate DKIM records in your Zoho Mail account settings.

## Step 4: Verify Domain ✔️

Once you have configured the MX and other DNS records, return to your Zoho Mail account and click **Verify Now** next to your domain.

## Step 5: Set Up Zoho Mail 📧

With domain verification complete, you can now set up email accounts, aliases, and other configurations in your Zoho Mail account.

Congratulations! You've successfully activated Zoho Mail for your custom domain. Enjoy secure and professional email services.
